OBJECTIVES
To be able to create self-contained projects in RStudio
To be able to use git from within RStudio
```

## R projects

- "File" -> "New Project"
- Best practices for project organization
    - Treat raw data as read-only.
    - Treat generated output as disposable
    - Separate function definition and application (as to avoid duplication)
    - Use version control

```{r}
doc/      # documents
data/     # raw data & metadata
results/  # files generated during cleanup & analysis
src/      # scripts
bin/      # other and compiled programs
```


## Git

- Use it
- `.gitignore` file to tell git what files to ignore
