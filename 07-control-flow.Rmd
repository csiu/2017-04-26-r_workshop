knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

```
OBJECTIVES
- Write conditional statements with if() and else().
- Write and understand for() loops.
```

## if/else statements

- IF true->do something:
```{r}
# if-statement
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}
```

- IF true->do something, ELSE do something else
```{r}
# if/else-statement
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

## for loops

- FOR-loops for iterating over a set of values

```{r}
for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}
```

- don't grow your results (computationally inefficient)
    - better way is to define empty output object and fill in the values
    
- WHILE-loops are used to repeat an operation until a certain condition is met

```{r}
while(this condition is true){
  do a thing
}
```
