Iâ€™ll be teaching an R workshop based on the [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) Software Carpentry lesson plan (lessons 1-10). The estimated teaching time (hrs) is:


```
## time_teaching time_exercise    time_total 
##      5.500000      2.333333      7.833333
```

I don't have that long, so in this repo I will condense down the lesson.

A list of R commands (parsed from the lessons) is found in [r-commands.md](r-commands.md).
