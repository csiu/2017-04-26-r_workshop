## CRAN task views

- is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into fields

## Help from peers

- `dput()` to dump the data youâ€™re working with into a format so that it can be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session
- `sessionInfo()` to print your current version of R & packages you loaded
